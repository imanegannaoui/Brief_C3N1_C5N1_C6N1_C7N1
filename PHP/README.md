__PHP__ is the most commonly used programming language for the web today. __PHP__ is very common because it has a relatively simple architecture compared to other *MVC* based web frameworks (*Python*, *Ruby*, *node.js*, etc).

Unlike the standard web frameworks, a __PHP__ file is actually an ``enhanced`` *HTML* file, which is also capable of executing code inside a document.
